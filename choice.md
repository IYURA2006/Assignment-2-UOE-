# Calculate the day number of the year #

# Audience #

The target audience for this challenge would be beginner Java programmers learning to deal with basic os Java, loops, and conditionals. They should have a basic understanding of Java concepts like arrays, variables, and functions. After solving this challenge, the programmer will become familiar with using algorithms and dealing with some edge cases (like leap years in this situation). So I think it is a good first project for a beginner developer like me.

# Main justifications for choosing this challenge #
I am confident about this challenge since the problem is not particularly complicated. The input format is minimal `YYYY/MM/DD`, and the process of finding the day number of the year is easy as long as the logic for the leap year is done correctly. The issue is challenging the use of basic Java constructs like loops, conditionals, and now OOP principles, which I have started studying. The ease of this challenge provides a good balance between challenging me to use basics of Java and helping me improve my object-oriented programming

# Confidence #
For this problem, the best design is the OOP approach. This design allows me to organise the logic in a class and separate responsibilities into different methods. I can create a class with methods like `isLeapYear()` and `getDayOfYear()`, which allows me to apply OOP concepts like encapsulation and method organisation promoting code readability and maintainability.

# Comparison of the winning design with the losing design #
The losing design would be the simple loop-based solution. While it is good to get the problem solved, it makes code more difficult to read and maintain, that is why I chose the OOP even if the loop would be more straightforward.
